5 thousand?

10?

20?

30?

36?

43
thousand
dollars!?

What do you
think Figaro?
Look!

Looks
great
darling…

Hooray, hooray,
filming ends 
today, and
we can
 get married

What are
you doing?
Just checking out... our new trailer!

It's a wedding gift from Mr. Almaviva
I don't
want it!

Why not? Do you have any idea how much these things cost?
Because I 
am your Susanna, 
and you 
are an idiot

Why wouldn't you want the best caravan on location?

We can park it next to Rosina's trailer so you can be right by her,
and I
can be near
Mr Almaviva.

Yeah.  And when Almaviva sends you off to buy 1000 brown M&Ms or whatever, he'll be right at my door

What are you saying?

Don't jump
to conclusions!
I'm trying
not to.

Almaviva is tired of sleeping with wannabe actresses, and is turning his attention to the crew...

Who?
Who do you think?

That's the whole point of this flashy caravan. He wants me close by.

Ugh. And Basilio is
telling me this is
the perfect way to advance my career

You thought it was out of respect for his First Assistant Director?
I did think…

for
“special little half-hours”,
he said.

It's Rosina.
You have to go.

Almaviva you bastard!
Now I see your plan more clearly,

On location, 
you the director,
me the assistant
director...
and Susanna
on the 
casting couch?
I don't
thinks so!

Wanna dance boss?
Come to my school..
I'll teach you a lesson!
First
I’ll find out
all your
secrets
Art
of
Fencing
Strike
here!
Joke
there!
Ruin. All.
Your. Plans.

You wait until the day of his wedding to tell me about this?

I wasn't expecting it so soon!

Figaro has certain... obligations towards me

If Susanna refuses Almaviva, he'll derail the wedding, then Figaro will be mine!

Leave it to me. I'll make some calls.

I discovered Rosina!
Figaro is the reason 
she went to Almaviva.
It ruined my career.

Vengeance is a pleasure reserved for the wise
Forgiveness 
is for
cowards!
wit
cunning
judgement
discretion
I'll make sure 
this contract 
is bulletproof.
I still have 
some clout 
in this town!
Figaro
will
be
yours.

Let's pretend
not to see her.

Why would Figaro marry that little tart? Probably knows Almaviva is sweet on her, so she's good for his career...
Gossipy old cow.
No-one
listens to her!

Look at her, all sweetness and light. But we all know...

And here's the lovely bride!


After you, you pretty young thing?
Oh no,
after you,
witty lady
After you!
After you!
I know 
my manners!

The bride to be!
The maid of honour!
The boss's favourite!
Hollywood's golden girl!
Your qualifications!
Your fashion sense!
Your position!
Your seniority!

@$&#**!!
Don't
make me
laugh.

Grumpy old bitch! Just because you've been around forever doesn't make you better than everybody else!

Cherubino!
What's wrong?

Almaviva's really going
to fire me this time.
Unless Rosina intervenes,
I'll never see you again!

You'll never see me again? Isn't Rosina the one you're always pining for?

I wish I were in your place; you get to dress her in the morning, undress her in the evening...

And what do you want me to do with this?
Show it to Rosina
Watch it yourself
Show it
to all women!


I don't know
What I am
What I'm doing
First
I’m on fire
then I'm freezing

Every woman
Sets my heart
beating
Forced to speak of love
by a desire I cannot explain

When I’m awake
When I’m asleep

to the seas
to the shadows
to the mountains

to the flowers
to the grass
to the fountains

to the echo
to the air
to the wind
And my words
are carried away
with them…
And when there’s
no-one around to hear
I speak of love
to myself
(My priest
says
I’ll go blind!)

Here he comes!

Susanna?
You look
out of sorts…

Great caravan huh?
Maybe you and I 
should have a 
little fun in here?

Where's the boss?
Get rid of him!
I’ll hide under here...

Susanna, babe,
have you seen 
Almaviva?
I haven't seen him! Why would you think that?

Figaro's
looking for him.

Oh the two of you really have it in for Figaro!
Let's see
Basilio
in action...
Babe, just 'cos the boss is
sweet on you doesn't mean
he don't like your husband. 
Know what I mean?

Get out, 
you vile panderer 
of slanders!

I'd have thought you'd prefer an affair with the boss...

What's this tape?

Is it for you, or is it one of his tributes to our leading lady?

Go sell it to the National Enquirer!

Hey I'm just repeating what everyone's saying!
And what
exactly 
is everyone saying?

You know my rule about on-set relationships! Where is that kid?

Ah, sorry, I obviously came at a bad time...

Um.
I don't feel well.
Oh, oh!
Put her
on
the bed...
Actually
I'm fine now!

About the boy,
I was just repeating 
what I heard...
No-one
should ever
listen to you!

Well,
I've already
fired him!
Poor kid!
Poor kid!
Poor kid? Poor kid?

The other day, I notice one of the extras' dresses doesn't look right...
so I pull it up
and what 
do I find?
The kid!

This keeps getting better and better...

I see
what's going on!
This
couldn't get
any worse!
This
couldnt get
any better!

Fetch Figaro.
I want him
to see this.
Fine!

Innocence 
needs no excuse!

He's been here the whole time. He asked me for help keeping his job...

So he heard
everything?

People
are coming!

You stay 
right here 
you little snake!

You know we're having our wedding during the wrap party...
…will you
give Susanna away?

I'll do it.
If we finish
the shoot today.
Go
find
Marcellina!

Am I still fired?
Don't worry,
my lips are sealed,
I'll never...

OK. You want to learn the business?
You can be an extra for my war film epic in Belgium.
You'll leave
today. Bye!

Hey Private Ryan, a word with you, before you go off to war!

No more flitting about,
amorous little butterfly,
day and night,
chasing pretty women...

no more
flat whites
no more
converse
trainers
no more
craft ales

soldiers! 
moustaches!
guns!
honour!
low pay!
marching!
trenches!
mud!

Over mountains
Through valleys
Snow
and burning sun
Trumpets
and cannonballs

Cheer up!
Maybe you’ll 
get to meet
Tom Hanks!

Cherubino!
To victory! 
To military glory!


How long has this been going on?
It hasn't!

But he tried to seduce you?

It's not about seduction;
I'm only a make-up girl, 
just another notch on his bedpost.

He doesn't love me any more!
Then why is he so jealous?

Men!  They're all the same.
Oh, but Figaro is different...

How’s it hanging ladies?
How can you joke about this!

I can make jokes and come up 
with brilliant plans at the same time!
I've left Basilio a letter,
ostensibly written by Rosina to a lover.

But my husband is so jealous!
Exactly! Makes him more likely to fall for it.
A little taste of his own medicine…

What about Marcellina?
But wait, there's more! We say you’ll meet him tonight.



But we send Cherubino, dressed up as you, and then 



let his leading lady catch him in the act.

I… guess so?

Good. I'll send Cherubino up,
and you take care of the disguises.

Then what?
Then me and the boss,
we're gonna dance.

I can’t believe Cherubino witnessed my husband, with you…
Hey, what's this other tape?
We'll make him show us.

Come on in John Snow!
Don’t remind me! I’m just sad to be away from such an amazing actress

And beautiful too...
Well.  Sure…
“well, sure” indeed! 
Why don't you show us your film?

Who is the director?
He's the one currently blushing.

You who know what love is
Look
to see 
if I have it in my heart.

I didn't know you were
such an auteur!
Yes he takes it very seriously.
That and coffee and fixed-wheel bikes.

You do have quite a feminine build don't you?

What if someone comes in?
I'll lock the door.

What are we going to do with this hair?
I have some hair extensions.  In the wardrobe.

It's my contract for the war film.
Looks like they forgot to sign it.

I'm almost jealous. Stop being so beautiful!

Enough messing about. Get the dress!

I wonder if the boss has seen "the Crying Game"

Go to wardrobe and get him something more... retro.

Susanna's laughing at me. And I have to leave, so soon...
Oh you poor kid. What bad luck.

These might be our last moments together...

My husband!
And you here!
And he'll have read Figaro's letter!

Who are you talking to?
Um, to no-one. To you?
I'm going to hide.
That's worked well 
every time so far.

Since when do you lock doors?
I was just changing...

... Changing costumes!
With Susanna.
She’s gone to Wardrobe.

Let's talk about this letter!

I didn't hear anything!
Because there's something else on your mind?

Maybe it's Susanna?
Who you just told
me went off to the 
wardrobe department?
Well, either there, 
or to the wardrobe 
in here. I didn't specify.

You're all flustered about something
You're the one that's all flustered,
about my make-up girl!

Let's just see shall we?

She can't come out! She's 
trying on her wedding outfit!

I'm sure
she  has
a lover in there!
I’m sure this
is going to end badly


I’m sure Cherubino
was in here?

If she can't come out,
she can still answer some questions! 

Careful, my wife…
Careful, my husband…
Careful!
Careful!
Confusion
and
scandal
loom over us

If you won't open it,
I'll get someone who will!
You want everyone
to know our business?

Fine.  I'll open it myself.
Let's lock this door, and go fetch some tools.

After you, Scarlett O'Hara.

See you when we get back, "Susanna"!

It's locked!
He'll kill me if he finds me!
He'll kill you if he finds you!
That's the garden stage      down there

It's too high!
At worst I'll break a couple of prop flowers.
Don't worry!
If I don't make it,     tell Rosina                  I love her.

Off he runs. Thank goodness he's all right.

Everything is as we left it.
Last chance, you wanna open this door?

You really think I've been cheating?

I'll find out who's in there, one way or another.
Yes you'll see him, but -
Him?  So it's not Susanna!

We were just planning a joke, it's totally innocent!

Who's in there? I'll kill him!
It's a boy...

Him again!  I am cursed to have that boy permanently underfoot?

You're scaring me!
Speak up!

There's a perfectly good explanation for this,
but he's not...

but he's not... he's in his underwear.

Because we were dressing him up as a girl!
Yeah, I know exactly what you were up to.

Give me the key!
He's innocent. You know...

Get out of here,
I never want to see you again,
and take your crap with you!

I'm not guilty!

I'll kill him.
I'll kill him.
And  that
will be the end of all this.
Jealousy consumes him.

Here I am.
If you're going to kill anyone,
it'll have to be me.

You're alone?
See for yourself.

He's OK. He jumped out of the window.
Clearly I owe you an apology.
But this was some joke!

You don't deserve forgiveness.
You don't deserve forgiveness.

I love you!
You're full of it!

Susanna, help me out here...
You're on your own!

This is what I get for being true?

Forgive you? You were
about to kick me out!
I'll make it up to you,
I promise...
Maybe you should give him a break?

I shouldn’t have to put up with this.

What was all that crap about the kid?
That was just a test.
You seemed truly upset though!
I am an actress.

But that letter was a low blow...
Figaro wrote it and handed it to Basilio...
So everyone was in on it!

Forgiveness is not due          to those            who     don't give it.

I'm not strong enough to stay angry with him...
I guess some men just always             get away  with it,          don't they?

I was wrong.
I’m sorry.
From this moment
may these two souls
live in
greater harmony

Come on, everything's ready for us to finish the shoot.

Not so fast...
How do you 
explain 
this note?
I don't know anything about it!

Are you sure you didn't give it to Basilio?
And our plans with the kid, remember?
Nope.  I know nothing.

I can read it on your face. You're lying.
Think what you like. I'm not lying.
It's no use Figaro,
we already told him...

So you admit it?
I admit nothing!
Come on, the game's over!

This is Hollywood.
It's not over
until
the big wedding at the end.
Get Marcellina
in here now!

What now?
I saw someone jump out of this window!
They smashed my prop flowers!

Someone jumped?  Where did they go?
I don't know, he got away.
It's OK, I saw him too.

Buddy, you're high on paint fumes...

He's tripping!
He's tripping!

Did you see his face?
No.

Don't get so worked up over a few flowers.
I admit it. It was me.

Didn't seem so tall when he jumped...
That's what happens when you jump out a window!

I thought it was the kid...
Probably came back to pick up his fixed-wheel bike.
I didn't see no bike jumping through the window!

All right.  Finish the story.
So, I jumped...
But why?

Right.
 I was hoping to…
catch a kiss
from my  wife-to-be, and then I...
heard a noise? and...
panicked and jumped out of the window, and...
and I twisted my ankle!
ow.

So these would be your papers that you dropped then?
Oh fuck.

So what are these papers?
I have so many... One second...

Maybe it's a list of his unpaid debts!
Maybe it's a list of your favourite huffing solvents!

You, start talking. And you, get out of here.
I'm going. But I think everyone should
have a little more respect for the props.

Of course! It's the kid's contract. 
He gave it to me. Because...
The signature!
It needs your signature.

I have no idea what's going on
We might just get away with this...
I have almost no idea what's going on.

Hang on, we're here, just in time!
What are these three idiots doing here?

Hang on, let's hear them out!

I have a marriage contract here
(they're very common in Hollywood)
saying that Figaro must marry me!

I am teh lawyer.
Fully legit.

I can be a character witness.
I know all about Figaro's debts.

Pipe down everyone!
I'll make sure we get to the bottom of this.

Confusion! Shock! Desperation!
Fortune!  Happy chance!
What kindly spirit 
What demon from hell 
sent those three here?
sent us here?
sent them here?
and everyone 
grows
a nose

An
anonymous letter..
The make-up girl
locked in the wardrobe
My wife
acting
suspicious
A man
jumps out of
her window
I have no idea
what's going on.

Maybe it was 
one of the crew? They're not above it..

But Rosina?
No, she respects herself too much.
And us...

Here we go. Tell him you'll meet him on the garden stage.
And that kid!
I'll get Basilio
to check he's
gone for good.

We don't need to tell Figaro. I'll be the one on the garden stage.

I need this.
Trust me.
If Susanna has
told anyone…
I'll have 
Marcellina 
marry Figaro
for sure!

You're angry!

Sir, your wife
wants her 
anxiety pills...

I'll bring them
back…
Hey babe, you
keep them, OK?

Oh I don't need
those!
A girl who's about 
to have her fiancé marry someone else?

Marcellina?
I thought you 
were going to 
take care of her?
When 
did I say that?

I thought that's
what you wanted?
Seems like what I want doesn't interest you much

Perhaps I do want
the same thing
you do...

You... 
Why lead me on 
until now?
Every woman 
has her time
for saying yes.

So... On the 
garden stage?
I'll be there.
My heart 
is filled 
with joy and
happiness.
Pardon me
if I lie, 
you who 
truly love.

People are coming!

Think again! I won’t
be Monica Lewinsky
to your Bill Clinton

Don't worry.
We won't
need a lawyer.
I've got this
 sewn up.

They've got this 
sewn up? Am I 
being set up?

I'm not going to be made a fool of!

Could he wriggle out of Marcellina's contract? That can't happen!

Aha! This is why you pay for the best lawyers in Hollywood!

Shall my servant be happy while I suffer?
Why should he have
What I can’t?
No, you
weren't  born,
audacious
fellow,
to laugh
at me!
Only revenge
now brings
me joy.

Has Susanna convinced him to meet her?
Is this a dangerous game?
No, I'll wear Susanna's clothes,
it’ll be dark...

What a humiliating state
I am reduced to!
Infidelity, jealousy, scorn,
Loved
Insulted
Betrayed
Forced
to turn to
one of my 
servants 
for help

What happened to our beautiful moments?
What happened
to the promises
of that lying tongue?
All changed to
tears and pain
So why do those
memories linger?
If only the pain
of my loyalty
would change
his ungrateful
heart!

It's either pay up,
or marry her.
At last!  A 
husband I 
actually like...

Help me out here?
It's either pay up,
or marry her,
right Curzio?

Finally
I am avenged!
I won't!
You will!
It's either pay up,
or marry her.

But surely my parents
must sign! They've not
been heard of for years.
Conveniently.

How?
Why?
Proof?
Witnesses!

Yes indeed!  I was found abandoned in an expensive car. And I have a distinctive birthmark...
In the shape of a strawberry?  On your right arm?

It's him!
It's me?
Who?
Who?
Who?

This is your mother.
His mother!
His mother!
And this
is your father.

Well, you can't marry your own mother. Wedding’s off.

Everyone, wait, I have money to pay off the contract!

You're already
at it!
It's not
what you think!

We tremble
with fury..
Because of
his destiny
Because
of my destiny
Because
of an 
old lady

Calm your fury.
I'm his mother, 
and that makes you 
my daughter!

His mother?
His mother.
His mother.
His mother.
His mother.

H
i
s
m
o
t
h
e
r
His mother.

And this 
is my father
Your father?
His father.
His father.
Etc. etc.

Yes. And this is my mother. Did I mention that?

Our souls hardly know how to resist this moment's...
Sweet 
content.
Fiery
torment.

Darling, look at him, the fruit of our ancient love..
OK, no-one wants
to hear the details. He's my son, so you'll be my wife.

Let's have a double wedding!  Today! Here, have this cheque
And you
should
still have
this cheque...
And this one...
Keep 'em coming 
everyone!  
I can handle it.

Who could be happier than I?
Me.
Me.
Me.

Yes yes, and I'm very pleased for you all. Now back
to my drama. 
Let's fix up your meeting with my husband. Write a note, and we'll add a video...

To a sweet moment, tonight
under the pine wood flats of the garden stage...

The camera, the note... and a rose. That'll do it.

And who is this beautiful extra?
Susanna, don't you think she looks familiar?

Come on, let's finish the shoot, or else, no wrap party, no dancing, and no wedding
Dancing? Your foot is better then?
Could be worse. 
So, back to
filming?

And the kid!
Is he at the war film set?
I'm sure he is.  Places, ladies!
But why did you have his contract?
Who cares?  Old news.  Action!

Let's get this last scene filmed so
they can finally get married!
Direct!

See the film
NrK 1, 21:30

What's this tape?
I think I know
who this is from...
Someone sent him
a sex tape? That'll
put him in a good
mood…
Might get done
today after all!

OK everyone, let's finish this up!
Then we really will have a wedding night we'll all remember..

Bla, Bla,
The Droit
De Seigneur,
bla,
it's a wrap!


What's wrong?

Don't jump to conclusions.
You can't be sure who's playing who...

It's her.
There's no doubt about it.
They're going to meet
on the garden stage...

Where are you going?
To take revenge
for all husbands!

No, I don't believe
Susanna would do this.

Why is it only when
we're not in competition
that we women
stick up for each other?

What's with the long face?

My faithful wife and my boss.
Having their own little party..

Guess my services as match-maker are no longer required then?

You guys stay right here and wait for my signal.

Susanna's got a
special meeting
with the boss and
Figaro doesn't like it.

Why should he have to put up with it?
Other people put up with it all the time.

In this world my friend,
powerful people
get what they want.
If you stand in the way,
you get run over.

Everything is ready.

Some
wedding night...

How could you?
In the ceremony
I was laughing, but really I was the joke.

Susanna! Your face,
your innocent eyes,
I still can't believe it...

Anyone that 
trusts a woman
is an idiot!

Open your eyes.
See women
for what they are
These you call
goddesses..

witches
who enchant
to cause us
pain
sirens
that sing
to land us
on the rocks
comets
that shine
to burn out 
our eyes

thorny roses
charming
vixens
smiling
bears
cruel
doves
mistresses
of intrigue

they feign
they lie
they feel no love
they feel
no pity

Everyone.
Knows.
This.

Figaro's coming!
One is hiding,
listening, the other
is on his way.
Let's start.

I'm cold, aren't you?
Yes. I will go to bed.
I'll stay out
a bit longer.

I'll teach them
both a lesson.

At last I can enjoy
my lover’s embrace,
unhurried 

Oh, come,
don't delay,
beautiful
joy
come where
love
calls you

Come,
my love
among these
hidden trees
I want to
crown you
with roses

I think
that's Susanna

Let's get
a little
closer…
Get out of here
you idiot,
you'll ruin
everything!

She's with
another man!
Is it the kid?
She's with
another man!
Is it the kid?
She's with
another man!
Is it the kid?


A little kiss?
You little...
You little...
You little...

!

They’re all 
on their way t
o learning 
a valuable lesson

Here I am. 
See anything
you like?
What an obliging little wife!

Such
soft
skin...
He doesn't know
what he's doing
He can't 
help himself.

Wait!
Here,   have this
highly identifiable
ring

Everything's going well, but the best is yet to come

Let's go
somewhere
more private

It's so dark
in there!
We're not going in
to read a book…

It's Figaro!
I have to go.
Stay right here.
I'll take care of it...

So, beautiful Venus has come to meet proud Mars…
But wily Vulcan will catch them in his net!

Rosina! Look!
My wife, your husband -
come here, I'll show you

Shh!  Listen,
come over here,
Um, I want revenge!

Susanna!
Revenge you say?

I'll trick him!
I'll trick her!

Here I am
at your feet,
my heart full
of jealous fire...
think
of your
treacherous
husband...

Give me
your hand...
Here!

Take that!
And that!
And that!

It's
a bit early
for S&M!
I'll teach you 
to play Don Juan!


You think I wouldn't 
recognise your 
beautiful voice?

OK. Let's pretend it never happened.

Where's she gone?
Susanna?

Great, he didn't recognise her.
Who?
Rosina!

Show
must go on,
I guess.

My
leading
lady...
Here I am,
do what
you want!

Everybody
out here now!

Look at this traitor! I've caught him. Guess who with?

Out you get. There's no hiding now!

The kid!
Rosina!
My mother!

Here she is, my treacherous wife...
This is a clear breach of our pre-nup!

Forgive me!
No, never!
Forgive us!
Never!
Forgive
them!
No, no no!

Maybe I can convince you?

Forgive me
my love.

I am more gentle, and say yes, I forgive you.

And the moral of the story is...

If you're going to be involved in an extramarital affair, you'd best hope that some complicated disguise-based shenanigans help you to realise who it was that you loved all along, before you do anything you'll regret.

Also, one excellent way of getting out of an arranged marriage is to realise that your spouse-to-be is directly related to you. 

Finally, if you're going to forgive your philandering husband, do it because you really love them, not because you think it's going to make it easier to defeat Donald Trump in the election.

THE END
