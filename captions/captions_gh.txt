5 grand? 10? 20? 30? 36? 43?  43 grand!?!



What do you think Figaro?  Look!




Looks great darling!


Hooray,
filming ends today,
and we can get married


What are you doing?


Just checking out...
our new trailer!





It's a wedding gift from Mr. Almaviva




I don't want it!





Do you have
any idea how much
these things cost?



Because I am your Susanna, and you are an idiot


Why wouldn't you want the best caravan on location?




We can park it next to
Rosina's trailer
so you can be right by her.


And I can be near Mr Almaviva.



Yeah.  And when Almaviva sends you off
to buy 1000 brown M&Ms or whatever,

he'll be at my door at a moment's notice...




What are you saying?







Don't jump to conclusions!

I'm trying not to.




Almaviva is tired
of sleeping
with wannabe actresses

And is turning his attention
to the crew...


 Who do you think?

That's the whole point
of this flashy caravan
he wants me close by.




And Basilio is telling me
this could be the perfect way
to advance my career



You thought it was
because he respects
his first AD?



I did think...


For "special little half-hours", he said.





It's Rosina.
You have to go.









Almaviva you bastard.
Now I see your plan
more clearly,


On location,
you the director,
me the assistant director...




and Susanna
on the casting couch?
I don't thinks so!






You wanna dance, boss?


Come to my school


I'll teach you a lesson.

But first I'll find out all your secrets.





Art


Of


Fencing


Strike here!


Joke there!

Ruin.
All.
Your
Plans.











You wait until the day
of his wedding
to tell me about this?


I wasn't expecting
it so soon!



Figaro has certain...
obligations towards me




If Susanna refuses Almaviva,
He'll derail the wedding,
then Figaro will be mine!


Leave it to me.
I'll make
some calls.


I discovered Rosina!
Figaro is the reason
she went to Almaviva.
It ruined my career.





Vengeance, oh, vengeance
is a pleasure reserved for the wise




Forgiveness is for cowards!

With cunning, wits,
judgement, discretion
One could...



I'll make sure
this contract is
bulletproof.



I still have some
clout in this town!
Figaro will be yours.





Let's pretend
not so see her.


Why would Figaro marry that little tart?

Probably knows Almaviva is sweet on her,
so she's good for his career...




Gossipy old cow.
No-one listens to her!



Look at her,
all sweetness and light.
But we all know...


lovely bride!





After you, you
pretty young thing?



Oh no, after you,
witty lady



After you!


After you!




I know my manners...




The bride to be!

The maid of honour!


The boss's favourite!


Hollywood wife!


Your qualifications!

Your fashion sense!


Your position!


Your seniority!


@*&*#$!


Don't make me laugh.






Grumpy old bitch!
Just because you've been
around forever doesn't make you
better than everybody else!





Cherubino!  What's wrong?



Almaviva's really going to
fire me this time.
Unless Rosina intervenes,
I'll never see you again!




You'll never see "me" again?
Isn't Rosina the one
you're always pining for?


I wish I were in your place;
you get to dress her in the morning,
undress her in the evening...


And what do you want
me to do with this?



Show it to Rosina,
watch it yourself,
show it to all women!






I don't know
What I am
What I'm doing


First I'm on fire
and then
I'm freezing


Every woman I see sets my pulse racing!



Forced to speak of love
By a desire I cannot explain





I talk of love when waking
I talk of love when dreaming,



To the water, to the shadows, to the mountains,
To the flowers, to the grass, to the fountains,
To the echoes, to the air, to the winds,


And the sound of my words
Is carried away with them.



And if I don't have anyone to hear me,
I talk of love to myself!

(My priest says I'll go blind!)






Here he comes!


Susanna?  You look upset






Great caravan huh?
Maybe you and I should
have a little fun in here?



Where's the boss?




I'll hide under here...





Susanna, babe, have
you seen Almaviva?



I haven't seen him!
Why would you think that?



Figaro's looking for him.




Why? The two of you
really have it in
for Figaro!



Let's see Basilio in action...




Hey babe, just 'cos the boss
is sweet on you doesn't mean
he don't like your husband.
Know what I mean?



Get out, you vile
panderer of slanders!




I'd have thought
you'd prefer an affair
with the boss...


What's this tape?





Is it for you, or
is it one of his
tributes to our
leading lady?


Go sell it to the
National Enquirer!




Hey I'm just repeating
what everyone's saying!





And what exactly
is everyone saying?







You know my rule about
on-set relationships!
Where is that kid?





Ah, sorry, I obviously
came at a bad time...



Um. I don't feel well.  Oh, oh!




Put her on the bed...




Actually I'm fine now!





About the boy,
I was just repeating
what I heard...





No-one should ever
listen to you!





Well, I've already
fired him!




Poor kid!





Poor kid? Poor kid?




The other day, I notice
one of the extras' dresses
doesn't look right...

so I pull it up,
and what do I find? The kid!



This keeps getting
better and better...





I see what's going on!


This couldn't get any worse!


This couldnt get any better!





Fetch Figaro.
I want him to see this.



Fine!




Innocence needs no excuse!




He's been hiding here
the whole time. He asked me
for help keeping his job...




So he heard everything?






You stay right here you little snake!







You know we're having our wedding during the wrap party...







Will you give Susanna away?



I'll do it. If we finish the shoot today...




Go find Marcellina!






Am I still fired?






Don't worry, my lips are sealed, I'll never...



OK. You want to learn the business?
You can be an extra for my big war film in Belgium.
You'll leave today.  Bye!





OK Private Ryan,
a word with you,
before you go off to war!




No more flitting about,
my amorous little butterfly,
day and night,
chasing all the pretty women...





soldiers!  Mustaches!  Guns! Swords!
Helmet!
Lots of honour,
Not much money,
Marching
Mud.
Cheer up!  Maybe you'll get to meet Tom Hanks.




Over mountains, through the valleys
In the snow and burning sun
To the music of trumpets,
Of shells and cannon-balls





Cherubino!
To victory!
To military glory!









How long has
this been going on?




It hasn't!



But he tried
to seduce you?





It's not about seduction;
I'm only a make-up girl,
just another notch
on his bedpost.


love me any more!




Then why is he
so jealous?





Men! They're
all the same.




I'm sure Figaro
is different...





Woa.  Take a
chill pill!



How can you
joke about this!



I can make jokes
and come up with
brilliant plans
at the same time!


I've left Basilio a letter,
ostensibly written by
Rosina to a lover.



But my husband
is so jealous!


Exactly! A little taste
of his own medicine.
And it'll buy us time...




What about Marcellina?




But wait, there's more!

We say you're going to
meet him later tonight.
But we'll send Cherubino,
dressed up as you,

and then we'll let his leading
lady catch him in the act.






Good. I'll send Cherubino up,
and you take care of the
disguises.


Then what?




Then me and the director,
we're gonna dance.









Poor Cherubino. I wish he
just came to me first...

Hey, what's this other tape?




We'll make him show us.


Ah, here he is.  Come on in John Snow!




Ugh, don't remind me.
I'm just sad to be away from
such an amazing actress




And beautiful too...



Well.  Of course...




Why don't you show us your film?




Who is the director?



He's the one currently blushing.







You who know what love is,
Look to see if I have it in my heart!









I didn't know you were such an auteur!


Yes he takes it very seriously.
That and coffee and fixed-wheel bikes.



You do have quite a
feminine build don't you?




What if someone comes in?



I'll lock the door.


Now what are we going
to do with this hair?





I have some hair extensions.
In the wardrobe.




It's my contract
for the war film.


Looks like they
forgot to sign it.




I'm almost jealous.
Stop being so beautiful!



Enough messing about.
Get the dress!




I wonder if
the boss has seen
"the Crying Game"


Go to wardrobe and
get him something
more... retro.



Susanna's laughing at me.
And I have to leave,
so soon...




Oh you poor kid.
What bad luck.




These might be our
last moments together...




My husband!  And you here!
And he'll have
read Figaro's letter!



It's just me...




Who are you talking to?


Um, to no-one. To you?


I'm going to hide.
That's worked well
every time so far.




Since when do you lock doors?


I was just changing...


... Changing costumes!
Susanna was with me.



Let's talk about this letter!





I didn't hear anything!



Because there's
something else
on your mind?




Maybe it's Susanna?


Who you just told me
went off to the
wardrobe department?


Well, either there, or
to the wardrobe in here.
I didn't specify.


You're all flustered about something




You're the one that's
all flustered, about
my wardrobe girl!


Let's just see
shall we?










She can't come out
she's trying on
her wedding dress!



I'm sure she has
a lover in there!





If she can't come out,
she can still
answer some questions!



A scandal, a confusion,
is looming over us!

A scandal, a confusion,
is looming over us!






If you won't open it,
I'll get someone
who will!




You want everyone
to know our business? 





Fine.  I'll open it myself.
Let's lock this door,
and go fetch some tools.







After you, Scarlett O'Hara.





See you when
we get back,
"Susanna"!











It's locked!





He'll kill you if he finds you



That's the garden stage down there...





Hey, at worst I'll
break a couple of prop
flowers.  Don't worry!






It's too high!




If I don't make it,
tell Rosina I love her.








Off he runs.
Thank goodness
he's all right.







Everything is as we left it.
Last chance, you wanna
open this door?




You really think
I've been cheating?



I'll find out
who's in there,
one way or another.




Yes you'll see him, but -



Him?  So it's not Susanna!





We were just
planning a joke,
it's totally innocent!




Who's in there?
I'll kill him!






It's a boy...








Him again!










You're scaring me!




Speak up!




There's a perfectly good
explanation for this,
but he's not...
he's in his underwear.






Because we were
dressing him up
as a girl!


Yeah, I know
*exactly* what
you were up to.





Give me the key!




He's innocent.
You know...




Get out of here,
I never want to see you again,
and take your crap with you!







I'm not guilty!




I'll kill him.
and that'll be
the end of all this.




Blind jealousy
consumes him.











Here I am.
If you're going
to kill anyone,
it'll have to be me.







You're alone?



See for yourself.









He's OK.
He jumped out
of the window.



Clearly I owe you
an apology.
But this was some joke!




You don't deserve forgiveness.


You don't deserve forgiveness.





I love you.






You're full of it!




Susanna, help me out here...




You're on your own!


This is what I get
for being true to you?











Forgive you?
You were about to kick
me out!




I'll make it up to you,
I promise...




Maybe you should give him a break?




I don't have to
put up with this.






What was all that crap
about the kid?





That was just a test.









I am an actress.







But that letter
was a low blow...





Figaro wrote it and
handed it to Basilio...



So everyone
was in on it!



Forgiveness is not due
to those who don't give it.




Come on, we've been
through worse than
this.




I'm not strong enough
to stay angry with him...




I guess some men just
always get away with it,
don't they?





From this moment,
may these two souls
be able to understand
each other better.






Everything's ready
for us to finish
the shoot.






Not so fast...






How do you explain this note?





I don't know anything about it!









Are you sure you didn't

give it to Basilio?





And our plans with the kid, remember?






Nope.  I know nothing.




I can read it on your face.
You're lying.




Think what you like.
I'm not lying.





It's no use Figaro,
we already told him...







So you admit it?




I admit nothing!





Come on, the game's over!





This is Hollywood.
It's not over until
the big wedding at the end.


It's not over til the fat lady sings.
Or in this case, until our wedding.








Get Marcellina in here now!





What now?



I saw someone jump out of this window!



Smashed my prop flowers!









Someone jumped?  Where did they go?




I don't know,
he got away.





It's OK, I saw him too







Buddy, you're high on paint fumes...









He's tripping!




Did you see his face?




No





Don't get so worked up
over a few flowers.
I admit it. It was me.





I don't believe it!




Didn't seem so tall when he jumped...




That's what happens
when you jump out a window.







I thought it was the kid...






Probably came back to pick up
his fixed-wheel bike.




I didn't see no bike
jumping through the window.





All right.  Finish the story.






So, I jumped...




But why?








Right.  I was hoping
to catch a kiss
from my wife-to-be,
and then I...

heard a noise?
and...

remembered the letter?

and so I...
panicked and

jumped out
of the window,

and... and I twisted my ankle!





So these would be
your papers that you
dropped then?






Oh fuck.




So what are these papers?



I have so many... One second...





Maybe it's a list
of his unpaid debts!




Maybe it's a list
of your favourite
huffing solvents!




You start talking.
And you, get out of here.





I'm going. But I think everyone
should have a little more respect
for the props.






Cherubino's war film contract!





Of course! It's
the kid's contract.
He gave it to me.
Because...





The signature!






It needs your signature.




I have no idea what's going on




We might just get away with this...


I have almost no idea what's going on.






Hang on, we're here, just in time!




What are these three idiots doing here?



Hang on, let's hear them out!




I have a marriage contract here
(they're very common in Hollywood)
saying that Figaro must marry me!








I am teh lawyer.
Fully legit.







I can be a character witness.
I know all about Figaro's debts.






Pipe down everyone!
I'll make sure we
get to the bottom of this.











confusion, shock desperation



good fortune!  happy chance!




what demon from hell
sent those three here?



what kindly spirit
sent them here?











An anonymous letter,
the make-up girl locked in the wardrobe,
my wife is acting suspicious...
a man jumps out of her window,

I have no idea what's going on.





Maybe it was one of the crew?
They're not above it...





But Rosina?  No, she respects herself too much.
And us...











This is it. Tell him you'll meet him on the garden stage.





And that kid! I'll get Basilio to check he's gone for good.


We don't need to tell Figaro.
I'll be the one on the garden stage, not you






I need this.  Trust me.




And if Susanna has told everyone...
I'll have Marcellina marry Figaro for sure!






You're angry!






Sir. Your wife is having one of her anxiety attacks,  she wanted one
of those pills...






I'll bring them back.




Hey babe, you keep them, OK?



Oh I don't need those!



A girl who's about to have her fiancé marry someone else?




Marcellina? I thought you were going to take care of her...




When did I say that?



I thought that's what you wanted?


Seems like what I want doesn't seem to interest you much.




Perhaps I do want the same thing you do...





You... Why lead me on until now?





Every woman has her time for saying yes.





So... On the garden stage?




I'll be there.







My heart is filled
with joy and happiness.




Pardon me if I lie,
all you who understand love.










People are coming!





joke?






Don't worry.  We won't need a lawyer.  I've got this sewn up.








They've got this sewn up?
Am I being set up?




I'm not going to be made a fool of!


Could he wriggle out of Marcellina's contract somehow?
We've got to make sure that can't happen.




Aha!  this is why you pay for the best lawyers in Hollywood!




Shall I see, while I suffer,
a servant of mine be happy!




No, you weren't born, audacious fellow,
to laugh at my unhappiness.




Only the hope of my revenge
now consoles my spirit,
and brings me joy.








Has Susanna convinced him to meet her?



Is this a dangerous game, with such a jealous husband?


No, I'll wear Susanna's clothes, and in the dark...





What a humiliating state I am reduced to,
by a cruel husband,



By a mixture of infidelity, jealousy and scorn,



First loved, then insulted, and finally betrayed,





Now forced to turn to one of my servants for help







Where are the beautiful moments,
the sweetness and happiness,



What happened to the promises
of that lying tongue?




Everything has changed to tears and pain,
why do those memories linger?







If only the pain of my loyalty
could change that ungrateful heart











It's either marry her, or pay up.






At last!  A husband I actually like...




Help me out here...



It's either marry her or pay up, right Don Curzio?







Haha finally I am avenged!






I won't!



You will!




It's either marry her, or pay up.









But surely my parents must be here to sign!
They've not been heard of for years.  Conveniently.





->


How?



Why?



Proof?



Witnesses!


Yes indeed!  I was found abandoned in an expensive car.
And I have a distinctive birthmark...


In the shape of a strawberry?  On your right arm?




It's him!



It's me?


Who?


x 3






This is your mother.






His mother!





And this is your father.










Well you can't marry your own mother...







Everyone, wait, I have money to pay off the contract!





You're already at it!



It's not what you think!









We tremble with fury...


Because of my destiny


Because of his destiny


Because of an old lady







Calm your fury.  I'm his mother, and that makes you my daughter!



His mother?



His mother














And this is my father...




Your father?



His father!











Yes.  And this is my mother.  Did I mention that?







Our souls hardly know
how to resist this moment's...



sweet content.



fiery torment.










Darling, look at this, the fruit of our ancient love...




OK OK, no-one wants to hear the details..
He's my son, and you'll be my wife,





Let's have a double wedding!  Today!


Here, have this cheque





You should still have this cheque...




And this one...


Keep 'em coming everyone!  I can handle it.













Yes yes yes, and I'm very pleased for you all.
Now back to my drama.  Let's fix up the details
of your meeting with my husband.  Write a note,
and we'll add a video...











To a sweet moment, tonight,
under the pine wood flats of the garden stage...









The camera, the note... and the rose.  That'll do it.













And who is this beautiful extra?
Won't you introduce yourself?
Susanna, don't you think she looks familiar?








Come on, let's finish the shoot,
or else, no wrap party, no dancing, and no wedding




Dancing? I guess your foot is better then?




It could be worse.  So, back to filming?







And that kid!  Has he arrived at the set of the war film?



I'm sure he has.  Places, ladies!




And why did you have his contract?




Who cares?  Old news.  Action!













Let's get this last scene filmed so they can finally
get married!



Direct!









Bla bla bla Jane Austen.




What's this tape? I think I know who this is from...




Looks like someone sent the boss a sex tape.  That'll
put him in a good mood. We might get done today after all.



OK everyone, let's finish this up, and then
we really will have a wedding night we'll
all remember.





Bla Bla Bla, The Droit De Seigneur, it's a wrap!











What's wrong?







Don't jump to conclusions.
You can't be sure
who's playing who...





It's her.  There's no doubt
about it. They're going to meet
on the garden stage...






Where are you going?




To take revenge for all husbands!









No, I don't believe
Susanna would do this.




Why is it only when we're not
in competition that we women
stick up for each other?







What's with the long face?





You'll see!  My faithful wife
and my boss. Having their own
little party...






Looks like my services
as a match-maker are
no longer required eh?






You guys stay right here
and wait for my signal.








Seems Susanna's got a
special meeting with the boss
and Figaro doesn't like it.






And why should he
have to put up with it?





Other people put up with it
all the time.




In this world my friend,
powerful people get what they want,
and if you stand in the way,
you get run over.









Everything is ready.




Some wedding night!




How could you?
In the ceremony I was laughing,
but really I was the joke.





Susanna! Your face,
your innocent eyes,
I still can't believe it...






Ah, anyone
that trusts a woman
is an idiot!






Open your eyes.
See women for what they are.





They are witches who enchant
to cause us pain,



sirens that sing to us
to land us on the rocks,



owls who allure us
to pluck out our feathers,


comets that shine on us
to burn out our eyes;



they're thorny roses,



they're charming vixens,




they're smiling bears,



cruel doves,



masters of intrigue,


friends of trouble,



they feign, they lie,
they feel no love,
they feel no pity,

no, no, no, no!
I won't say the rest,
everyone knows it already!











Figaro's coming






One is hiding listening,
the other is on his way,
let's start.







Oo, I'm cold,
aren't you?




Yes. I will go to bed.






I'll stay out a bit longer.








I'll teach them
both a lesson.






At last the moment approaches
which I'll enjoy unhurried
in my beloved's arms.





Oh, come, don't delay,
beautiful joy,
come where love
calls you for enjoyment,





Come, my love,
among these hidden trees,
I want to crown you with roses.











I think
that's Susanna




That must be
my husband.







Let's get a little closer








Get out of here
you idiot, you'll
ruin everything!














She's with another man, is it the kid?







A little kiss...







you little...








We've got to get
that kid out of here,
or he'll ruin the plan





It's him!






!




Everyone is on their way
to learning a valuable lesson







Here I am.
See anything you like?




What an obliging
little wife!









Such soft skin...





He doesn't know what he's doing,



He can't help himself.




Wait, here, have this highly identifiable ring



Wait, here, have this highly incriminating ring







Everything's going well,
but the best is yet to come





Let's go somewhere more private




It's so dark in there!




We're not going in to read a book.






?abstract for these guys?






It's Figaro.
I have to go.





Stay right here.
I'll take care of it...











So, beautiful Venus
has come to meet proud Mars.
But wily Vulcan will
catch them in his net!







Rosina! Look!
My wife, your husband -
come here, I'll show you





Shh.  Listen,
come over here,
I want revenge!






Susanna!




Revenge you say?








I'll trick him


I think not!  I'll trick her...






Here I am your feet my lady,
my heart full of jealous fire,
think of your treacherous husband...








Give me your hand...





Here!





Take that!
And that,
and that!






It's a bit early
for S+M!




Elegant slaps
from an elegant lady!





I'll teach you
to play Don Juan!







Peace, my love.
You think I wouldn't recognise
your beautiful voice?






OK. Let's pretend
it never happened.




Where's she gone?






Susanna?



Great, he didn't
recognise her




Who?



Rosina?





All right, let's keep the show going.





My leading lady...






Here I am,
do what you want!






[emoji kisses]?




Everybody out here now!










Look at this traitor!
I've caught him.
Guess who with?




What are we seeing?


Out you get.
There's no hiding now!




The kid!



My mother!


Rosina!


Here she is,
my treacherous wife...



This is a clear breach
of our pre-nup!




Forgive me!




No, never!



Forgive us!




Never!



Forgive them!



No, no no!



Maybe I
can convince you?







Forgive me,
my love.




I am more gentle,
and say yes,
I forgive you.









And the moral of the story is...

If you're going to be involved in an extramarital affair,
you'd best hope that some complicated disguise-based
shenanigans help you to realise who it was that you
loved all along, before you do anything you'll regret.

Also, one excellent way of getting out of an arranged
marriage is to realise that your spouse-to-be is directly
related to you.


Finally, if you're going to forgive your philandering husband,
do it because you really love them, not because you think it's
going to make it easier to defeat Donald Trump in the election.
